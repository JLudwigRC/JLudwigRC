# Hi!, I’m Luis Romero 👨‍💻

## .NET Software Engineer 

i've been fortunate to witness technological evolution driven by engineering and innovation - Transforming televisions, the internet, cell phones and cassettes 
into smaller and more efficient devices, or increasingly common services.

As an experienced developer, it's a pleasure to be part of this new era enjoying the discovery of new technologies.

I consider knowledge an invaluable treasure, and the mind, the medium that transforms the impossible into reality.

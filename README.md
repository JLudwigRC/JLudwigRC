# Hi!, I‚Äôm Josef Ludwig üë®‚Äçüíª

## .NET Software Engineer 

i've been fortunate to witness technological evolution driven by engineering and innovation - Transforming televisions, the internet, cell phones and cassettes 
into smaller and more efficient devices, or increasingly common services.

As an experienced developer, it's a pleasure to be part of this new era enjoying the discovery of new technologies.
